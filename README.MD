# Formatter of numbers into Slovene words

This code formats numbers into Slovene words. It supports all
Slovene grammatical genders and cases. It is written in Haxe
which can be transpiled into many popular languages.

The implementation is tested against test cases from the
[zapis-slovenskih-stevil](https://github.com/gregopet/zapis-slovenskih-stevil)
project.

It currently only supports standard signed integers until I
figure out how to best support bigger decimals. Decimal support
will also be added one day.
